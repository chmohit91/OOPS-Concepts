# Object-Oriented Mastery

Welcome to Object-Oriented Mastery, your comprehensive guide to mastering object-oriented programming principles, patterns, and practices. This repository represents a carefully curated collection of knowledge and practical implementations that will help you understand and apply object-oriented concepts effectively in real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose

Our mission is to provide a structured, thorough understanding of object-oriented programming that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. Whether you're a student beginning your programming journey or a seasoned developer looking to deepen your expertise, this repository offers valuable insights and hands-on examples to enhance your object-oriented programming skills.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

### Core Concepts
We begin with fundamental object-oriented principles, ensuring you have a solid foundation:
- Encapsulation: Understanding data hiding and abstraction
- Inheritance: Leveraging code reuse and establishing relationships
- Polymorphism: Implementing flexible and extensible designs
- Abstraction: Creating meaningful abstractions for complex systems

### Design Pattern Implementations
Explore practical implementations of essential design patterns:

**Creational Patterns**
- Factory Method: Creating objects without specifying exact class
- Abstract Factory: Families of related objects
- Builder: Step-by-step complex object construction
- Prototype: Cloning objects
- Singleton: Single instance management

**Structural Patterns**
- Adapter: Interface compatibility
- Bridge: Implementation decoupling
- Composite: Tree structures
- Decorator: Dynamic functionality
- Facade: Simplified interfaces
- Flyweight: Shared object optimization
- Proxy: Object access control

**Behavioral Patterns**
- Chain of Responsibility: Command processing
- Command: Request encapsulation
- Iterator: Collection traversal
- Mediator: Object cooperation
- Observer: State change notification
- Strategy: Algorithmic variation
- Template Method: Algorithm structure

### Advanced Topics
- Aspect-Oriented Programming integration
- Domain-Driven Design implementation
- Test-Driven Development practices
- Reactive programming patterns
- Concurrent object-oriented design
- Memory optimization techniques

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 💻 Code Examples

Each pattern implementation includes:
- Source code in multiple programming languages
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation explaining:
  - Context and problem statement
  - Solution approach
  - Implementation considerations
  - Best practices
  - Common pitfalls to avoid

Here's a simple example of the Strategy pattern:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, card_number: str, expiry: str, cvv: str):
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.expiry = expiry
        self.cvv = cvv
    
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        # Implementation of credit card payment processing
        print(f"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}")
        return True

class PayPalPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, email: str, password: str):
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
    
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        # Implementation of PayPal payment processing
        print(f"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}")
        return True

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self, payment_strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.payment_strategy = payment_strategy
        self.amount = 0
    
    def checkout(self) -> bool:
        return self.payment_strategy.pay(self.amount)
```
